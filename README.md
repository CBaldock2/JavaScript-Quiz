# JavaScript-Quiz

## Description
The goal with this project was to create a quiz over JavaScript. This is a 5 question, timed quiz asking some basic JavaScript questions. If you get a question correct you get points added to your score. Once complete with the quiz you total score, which is 5 points for every question correct as well as the remaining time added together. The quiz is also over if the timer runs out. You can see you previous scores to compare or clear the scores and start fresh.

## Usage
To use the JavaScript quiz you begin by pressing the start button. Pressing the start button initiates the timer and makes the first question appear. You answer once question at a time, if you get a question correct you will get 5 points added to your final score and if you get a question wrong time will be deducted from the remaining time. Once finished it will ask you to input your initials and press submit. You can then chose to look at the high scores or return to the beginning. If you chose to see the high scores there will be a list of previous scores. You can clear the scores and start building them all over.
